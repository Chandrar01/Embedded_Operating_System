./RoundRobin.o

For verifying implementation of SJF algorithm

gcc SJF.c -o SJF.o
./SJF.o


For verifying implementation of FCFS algorithm

gcc FCFS.c -o FCFS.o
./FCFS.o

For verifying implementation of MLFQ algorithm

gcc MLFQ.c -o MLFQ.o
./MLFQ.o


To change the quantum and workload you need to modify macro definitions in the respective C files
